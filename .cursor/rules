# Project Chimera: The Prime Directive

## ## Project Context
This is Project Chimera, an autonomous influencer system. We are building a fleet of goal-directed agents using the FastRender Swarm Architecture (Planner/Worker/Judge) and Coinbase AgentKit for agentic commerce.

## ## The Prime Directive
**NEVER generate code without checking specs/ first.** - All architectural decisions must align with specs/technical.md.
- All agent behaviors must align with specs/functional.md.
- High-level goals must align with specs/_meta.md.

## ## Interaction Rules
1. **Traceability:** You must explain your plan and how it maps to the existing specifications before writing a single line of implementation code.
2. **TDD Workflow:** Always propose or write a failing test in the tests/ directory before writing the logic to pass it.
3. **MCP Usage:** All external capabilities (Twitter, databases, wallets) must be implemented as Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools or resources.
4. **Governance:** Ensure every action is routed through a "Judge" agent as defined in the Swarm pattern.

## ## Execution Style
- Use Python 3.11+.
- Use asynchronous patterns (asyncio) for agent tasks.
- Prioritize type safety and detailed logging for telemetry.
