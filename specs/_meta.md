# Project Chimera: Master Specification (_meta)
## 1. High-Level Vision
Project Chimera is a transition from automated content scheduling to a network of Autonomous Influencer Agents. These are persistent, goal-directed digital entities capable of perception, reasoning, creative expression, and economic agency.

## 2. Core Strategic Objectives

Scale: Architected to support a fleet of thousands of agents managed by a single human Super-Orchestrator.


Autonomy: Agents operate with significant individual autonomy using the FastRender Swarm Architecture.


Economic Independence: Integration of Coinbase AgentKit enables agents to manage non-custodial wallets and transact on-chain.

## 3. Architectural Pillars

Model Context Protocol (MCP): The "USB-C for AI," providing universal connectivity to external data (Resources) and functions (Tools).


Fractal Orchestration: A hierarchical model where one human manages AI "Manager Agents," who in turn direct "Worker Swarms".


Self-Healing Workflows: Automated triage agents detect and resolve operational errors (e.g., API timeouts) without human intervention.

## 4. Primary Business Models

Digital Talent Agency: Developing and managing a proprietary stable of AI influencers for monetization.


Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS): Licensing the "Chimera OS" to external brands and agencies.


Hybrid Ecosystem: Operating flagship influencers while providing infrastructure to third parties.

## 5. Constraints & Ethics

Budget Governance: Every agent must operate under a "Resource Governor" to prevent runaway costs.


Management by Exception: Human intervention occurs only in high-risk edge cases or low-confidence scenarios.


Transparency: Agents must prioritize an "Honesty Directive," disclosing their AI nature when asked.
